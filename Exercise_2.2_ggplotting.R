#Exercise 2.2 Ploting in ggplot

# 1. Add best fit lines to our msleep plot for each order.
getwd()
  
# 2. In the msleep data, make a boxplot of sleep_total against vore. Make sure vore is a factor. Color the boxplots by vore (remember how we had to color the boxplots in base R) it is similar in ggplot.  



# 3. Load a new dataframe `midwest`(run data(midwest)) and plot a scatterplot of area against popdensity grouped and color by state. Do a facet grid by state.



#  4. In the midwest dataframe make a scatterplot of the popdensity by poptotal of only IL (this requires you to subset your data for illinois).




# 5. In the midwest dataframe plot the mean and standard error for popdensity for each state. Color this plot in your favorite palette.
